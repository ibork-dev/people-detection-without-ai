# People Detection and Tracking in Video Sequences with basic Image Processing Skills

This project focuses on detecting and tracking people in video sequences using classical computer vision techniques. I employed Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) for robust human detection, a Kalman filter for smooth tracking of individuals across frames, and SIFT feature matching to distinguish between different people. The project demonstrates an integrated approach to real-time monitoring and identification using fundamental image processing methods.
